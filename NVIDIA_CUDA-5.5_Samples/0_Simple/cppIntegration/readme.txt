Sample: C++ Integration
Minimum spec: GeForce 8

This example demonstrates how to integrate CUDA into an existing C++ application, i.e. the CUDA entry point on host side is only a function which is called from C++ code and only the file containing this function is compiled with nvcc. It also demonstrates that vector types can be used from cpp.
