Sample: Simple Peer-to-Peer Transfers with Multi-GPU
Minimum spec: GeForce GTX 400

This application demonstrates the new CUDA 4.0 APIs that support Peer-To-Peer (P2P) copies, Peer-To-Peer (P2P) addressing, and UVA (Unified Virtual Memory Addressing) between multiple Tesla GPUs.

Key concepts:
Asynchronous Data Transfers
Unified Virtual Adress Space (UVA)
Peer to Peer Data Transfers
